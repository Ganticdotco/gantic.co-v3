      <h3>Project Kick-off</h3>
      <p>We were initially approached in late 2016 to undertake a performance and tech audit of Adam Scott’s Mi Golf Club, an iOS and Android app that had seen only a limited beta release after two years in development, which was being built by members of the Scott family business with various design and development contractors.</p>
      <p>Upon reviewing the app, we identified what we felt to be some significant UX and product strategy issues, and proposed a two week ‘Recon’ engagement to deep-dive into their app, their user-base, and their industry, and advise them on potential solutions.</p>

      <h3>Product Recon</h3>
      <p>Myself and Jared Fossey, a then newly hired design strategist at Josephmark, spent the next two weeks performing Josephmark’s first ‘Product Recon’ – trying to do as much research and analysis around the product, it’s potential market of users, and it’s industry context as was possible in a limited time. </p>
      <p>Our goal was to learn enough to be able to identify particular problems that could be defined and validated for an existing market of golfers, and to make a recommendation whether or not the client should continue trying to work towards solving that problem.</p>
      <p>We worked with the MiGolfClub team to define persona based segments of audience, to explore existing and potential business models in the industry, and to get a high level view of the existing Golf-app ecosystem.</p>
      <p>By the end of the two week, we’d uncovered a handful of inter-dependant problems and opportunities they might be positioned to navigate, and had developed a broad vision for how that might look, and how we might get there.</p>

    <h3>Full Swing</h3>
      <p>Having received the go-ahead, I formed a team with Designers David Whipps and Hamish Snow, iOS Developer Michael Henderson, and Project Manager Anson Cheung, to begin further defining the problem, while tentativel exploring the solution space.</p>
      <h4>Problem #1</h4>
      <p>The strongest of the problems we’d identified which the team might have a unique ability to solve was:</p>
      <p class="quote">Golfers can’t objectively measure their longer term performance progress, beyond broad indicators such as handicap changes, into specific elements of their game.</p>
      <p>Through our research, we felt that all the major products in this area were too technical and jargon heavy for the average golfer.</p>
      <p>Of the many features in the existing Mi Golf Club app, an ultra-simple scorecard and statistics feature had received the most positive feedback and excitement from beta users.</p>
      <p>With a name like Adam Scott’s to promote it, we felt that a finely tuned interaction design could be a real differentiator in this product space.</p>
      <h4>Problem #2</h4>
      <p>But there was also another problem we felt they had a unique opportunity to solve:</p>
      <p class="quote">There’s no easy way to discover and compare courses in a specific location, other than struggling with incomplete websites and social media profiles.</p>
      <p>This too was a problem uncovered by reactions to a feature already implemented in the existing app, their ‘Global Golf Atlas’ course discovery database.</p>
      <p>After being quoted a significantly high price to use a third-party database they’d decided, through a kind of naive optimism, to just build their own. They’d then spent much of the next two years paying an outsourced team to scrape and farm information about the majority of clubs and courses in Australia, North America, The U.K. and much of Europe and Asia, and had amassed a rich database of over of over 35,000 courses at that point.</p>
      <p>They’d also partnered with photographers and videographers from around the world to collect beautiful imagery for the most highly-regarded courses, including drone fly-overs for many of the higher profile ones.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="project-content">
    <div class="content-group">
      <h4>Intertwined Solutions</h4>
      <p>Our initial reaction was that we should focus on one of these problems, excluding the other until we'd proved (or disproved) Product-Market-Fit.</p>
      <p>On further exploring the options, it began to feel as though the solutions to these problems could be more than the sum of their parts, and possibly even have an exponential effect on each other.</p>
      <p>Whilst an intuitive scoring interface may give us the data to be able to produce insightful statistics and actionable suggestions, combining that with a club facing product and course discovery platform would allow us to incentivise courses to maintain their own scorecards and profiles, in order to optimse discovery by golfers, as well as manage bookings and customers, in turn allowing us to offer helpful analytics to courses about usage data of their course, and the norms for their area.</p>

      <figcaption>Comparing value prop of a single audience focus vs a two-sided market</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div class="content-group">
      <p>Ultimately we imagined as many as six potential products we might build that could each add value to the others – but it we could only start with one, and we needed something that had the ability to build the user base which could become the foundation for the other concepts.</p>
      <p>Our recommendation was to start by attempting to validate the potential of, and interest in, a free consumer app that solved one or both of these problems for a wide golfing audience</p>

    <div class="content-group">
      <h3>The Process</h3>
      <p>Once we had buy in from all stakeholders, we began exploring the information architecture, and expermenting with combinations of features, in an attempt to define what would be the quickest we could deliver real value to the users, and what would be a realistic scope and timeline for launch.</p>

    <figcaption>An early exploration of the IA map and navigation structure of the app.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <section class="project-content">
    <div class="content-group">
      <p>Next we began exploring wireframes of the key areas of the product, constantly prototyping and sense-checking the structure and content by running it past both the partners, with their deep background in the sport, and our in-house 'subject matter expert' – the cousin of the studio founder, and a total golf nut.</p>
      <p>Very quickly we arrived at a point that we, our partners, and Andy all <em>felt</em> the app was making sense, but we really needed to validate our assumptions, and felt that testing a prototype with members of the target audience would be the best way to do that.</p>
      <p>We arranged a series of user interviews with golfers who matched our key audience behaviours, during which we planned to asses their interest and excitement for our prototype. Considering none of our participants knew anything about design or app development, we didn't want to show them grey box wireframes with no images and fake content, so we quickly skinned the wireframes, adding realistic content and images to make it feel like a real golf app.</p>

    <img class="project-img" src="../img/project-birdie-prototype.png" alt="A quick UI skin added to our wireframes">

  </figure>
  <section class="project-content">
    <div class="content-group">
      <p>The testing was a massive success. With a few usability tweaks, a whole lot of golf jargon corrections, and a high level of interest in the app. All participants indicated excitement to try the product, and as we intentionally didn't tell them the app would be a free release, a few even showed a willingness to 'sign up for the product early to get a discount'. </p>

    <div class="content-group">
      <h4>An Aside: Why Wireframes Don't Always Work</h4>
      <p>The scoring flow in Pin was easily the most complex feature in terms of interaction design.</p>
      <p>We explored numerous design directions for the feature, trying to find a way to balance the depth and detail of data we wanted users to be able to capture for each hole against the desire for the process to feel as simple as possible and take minimal time.</p>
      <p>One of the early directions I explored involved a card metaphor interface, with each hole represented by a card of UI elements for each of the different stats, which the user could swipe through, completing as much or as little of the statistical detail as they desired.</p>
      <p>Intuitively I felt like this was the direction that would best balance our seemingly contradictory objectives of depth and power vs simplicity and speed. However, when I sketched it quickly on a whiteboard, or threw together a quick wireframe, others on the team would immediately shut it down as too complex, too noisy, too intimidating.</p>
      <p>Not to be discouraged, as I still believed there was something to it, as I continued on to design the 'safer' direction agreed with the team, which required sacrificing a little of the statistical depth, I also spent some of my own time beginning to flesh out the card-based version in a rough UI design layer.</p>
      <p>Designing the feature in higher fidelity UI gave me the ability to demonstrate the affordances and signifiers that could be included to help the user understand how each element might be interacted with, in more subtle ways than I could when sketching or wireframing.</p>

      <p>After preparing a quick Invision prototype of the scoring flow concept, the team and the client immediately changed their opinion of the concept and we began fleshing it out more seriously for user testing.</p>
      <p>Other than a few minor tweaks and the update to the branded UI, this concept is basically the scoring flow that shipped in the app, and consistently gets the most positive feedback from users of any feature in the app.</p>

      <h3>Refinement & Production</h3>
      <p>With the core feature set locked in and 'validated' as best as we could through qualitative research, it was time to knuckle down and solidify the visual design.</p>
      <p>Much of the initial visual and brand design on the project was led by <a href="http://www.davidwhipps.com/" target="_blank" title="David Whipps • Digital product designer">David Whipps</a>, with key support from <a href="https://hamishsnow.co/" target="_blank" title="Hamish Snow • Digital product designer">Hamish Snow</a>, while I focussed my efforts specifically on the interaction and data heavy Scoring and Stats sections, only occassionally jumping in to the brand and content heavy sections to provide feedback to the others, or to collaboratively riff on icons or typography.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Throughout the project we constantly updated and evolved an Invision prototype, which we'd initially wired up as wireframes, and used for user research throughout, until eventually it became a complete prototype of the final UI designs.</p>
      <p>This prototype then acted as a reference point for discussions with developers, as well as an easy way to manage feature and functionality discussions and feedback with stakeholders.</p>

      <h3>Iteration & Delivery</h3>
      <p>In April 2017, David and Hamish were moved to another project after the first round of visual design had been completed, and I spent the next six months acting as the sole designer, product manager and QA on the team as I worked with the developers to prepare the app for a beta launch, whilst testing and iterating the product as we went.</p>
      <p>Three months later, in June, we released a private beta of the app to a few hundred users who had signed up on our website, and included Intercom into the build to allow easier feedback from the users, and the communication of updates, changes or status changes back to them.</p>
      <p>One of our biggest unknowns heading towards the launch was whether the backend architecture we'd inherited from Mi Golf Club would be able to handle any kind of scale of use, so we felt we needed to limit growth of the app while we tested it in production.</p>
      <p>So, a few months later, in September, we quietly moved the beta into the App Store to expand the beta, with an invite code requirement built into the app so we could control the rate of new users as we began inviting the rest of the waitlist.</p>

      <h3>Launch & Reception</h3>
      <p>In Novembner the app was launched in the Australian and New Zealand App Stores, a limitiation we'd decided on as a test market for the app where we knew Adam Scott's name alone would be enough to get some traction.</p>
      <p>The plan was to assess the performance of the app in Aus/NZ, and give ourselves a chance to iterate on any weak points before spending big on promoting an international launch.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content-group">
      <p>On November 30, 2017, Adam Scott joined the commentary team during the first round of the Australian PGA Championship for a short segment around lunchtime on a Thursday, and announced the release of the app.</p>
      <p>We were inundated with an immediate and huge spike in downloadsm, which, due to an issue with our provider not applying requested settings, crashed our servers in about 3 minutes.</p>
      <p>We were able to get the server back up within another 3 minutes, and the download spike continued for about 20 minutes after that.</p>
      <p>And then the feedback, support requests, and bug reports started flooding in.</p>
      <p>Overall, I'd call the launch a modest success. Feedback was generally positive, and most bugs reports were related to incorrect course scorecard info – which, once we implemented a support management system, became a great way to crowdsource updated data.</p>

      <h3>Beyond Launch</h3>
      <p>After the launch, we made a few bug-fixes and a couple of small improvements, but generally the product was performing okay. So we started working on a stats based coaching feature we'd had to withold from release.</p>
      <p>The feature involved analysing a players performance upon submitting a scorecard compared to their previous averages and recent performances, on a range of statistical combinations and ratios, and suggesting various coaching videos or articles that might help improve in that specific area.</p>
      <p>Whilst development continued on that feature, I also began exploring the requirements and potential scope of the second club-facing product, which would likely include some kind of round-booking platform, but would also include improvements to the existing club-facing CMS for managing club profiles and course scorecards.</p>
      <p>In mid-December 2017, we got the call to halt work on the app, while the terms of the partnership were being negotiated. I left Josephmark shortly after and don't know what happened with this project since.</p>
