      <h3>Project Kick-off</h3>
      <p>We were initially approached in late 2016 to undertake a performance and tech audit of Adam Scott’s Mi Golf Club, an iOS and Android app that had seen only a limited beta release after two years in development, which was being built by members of the Scott family business with various design and development contractors.</p>
      <p>Upon reviewing the app, we identified what we felt to be some significant UX and product strategy issues, and proposed a two week ‘Recon’ engagement to deep-dive into their app, their user-base, and their industry, and advise them on potential solutions.</p>

      <h3>Product Recon</h3>
      <p>Myself and Jared Fossey, a then newly hired design strategist at Josephmark, spent the next two weeks performing Josephmark’s first ‘Product Recon’ – trying to do as much research and analysis around the product, it’s potential market of users, and it’s industry context as was possible in a limited time. </p>
      <p>Our goal was to learn enough to be able to identify particular problems that could be defined and validated for an existing market of golfers, and to make a recommendation whether or not the client should continue trying to work towards solving that problem.</p>
      <p>We worked with the MiGolfClub team to define persona based segments of audience, to explore existing and potential business models in the industry, and to get a high level view of the existing Golf-app ecosystem.</p>
      <p>By the end of the two week, we’d uncovered a handful of inter-dependant problems and opportunities they might be positioned to navigate, and had developed a broad vision for how that might look, and how we might get there.</p>

    <h3>Full Swing</h3>
      <p>Having received the go-ahead, I formed a team with Designers David Whipps and Hamish Snow, iOS Developer Michael Henderson, and Project Manager Anson Cheung, to begin further defining the problem, while tentativel exploring the solution space.</p>
      <h4>Problem #1</h4>
      <p>The strongest of the problems we’d identified which the team might have a unique ability to solve was:</p>
      <p class="quote">Golfers can’t objectively measure their longer term performance progress, beyond broad indicators such as handicap changes, into specific elements of their game.</p>
      <p>Through our research, we felt that all the major products in this area were too technical and jargon heavy for the average golfer.</p>
      <p>Of the many features in the existing Mi Golf Club app, an ultra-simple scorecard and statistics feature had received the most positive feedback and excitement from beta users.</p>
      <p>With a name like Adam Scott’s to promote it, we felt that a finely tuned interaction design could be a real differentiator in this product space.</p>
      <h4>Problem #2</h4>
      <p>But there was also another problem we felt they had a unique opportunity to solve:</p>
      <p class="quote">There’s no easy way to discover and compare courses in a specific location, other than struggling with incomplete websites and social media profiles.</p>
      <p>This too was a problem uncovered by reactions to a feature already implemented in the existing app, their ‘Global Golf Atlas’ course discovery database.</p>
      <p>After being quoted a significantly high price to use a third-party database they’d decided, through a kind of naive optimism, to just build their own. They’d then spent much of the next two years paying an outsourced team to scrape and farm information about the majority of clubs and courses in Australia, North America, The U.K. and much of Europe and Asia, and had amassed a rich database of over of over 35,000 courses at that point.</p>
      <p>They’d also partnered with photographers and videographers from around the world to collect beautiful imagery for the most highly-regarded courses, including drone fly-overs for many of the higher profile ones.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="project-content">
    <div class="content-group">
      <h4>Intertwined Problems</h4>
      <p>Our initial reaction was that we should focus on one of these problems, excluding the other until we'd proved (or disproved) Product-Market-Fit.</p>
      <p>On further exploring the options, it began to feel as though the solutions to these problems could be more than the sum of their parts, and possibly even have an exponential effect on each other.</p>
      <p>Whilst an intuitive scoring interface may give us the data to be able to produce insightful statistics and actionable suggestions, combining that with a club facing product and course discovery platform would allow us to incentivise courses to maintain their own scorecards and profiles, in order to optimse discovery by golfers, as well as manage bookings and customers, in turn allowing us to offer helpful analytics to courses about usage data of their course, and the norms for their area.</p>
      <p>Ultimately we imagined as many as six potential product we could build that would each add value to the others – but it we could only start with one, and we needed something that had the ability to build the user base on which all other concepts required.</p>
      <p>Our recommendation was to start by attempting to validate the potential of, and interest in, a free consumer app that solved one or both of these problems for a wide golfing audience</p>

      <h3>Scoping the Green</h3>
      <p>We formed a partnership with the Scott Golf Designs team, and spent the next two weeks working to define a 'first-horizon' vision for the product by prototyping concepts to gauge interest and validate our hypotheses in the market, hoping to define what might be the minimum feature set required.</p>
      <p>One of the unique challenges we faced on this project was that due to Adam Scott’s involvement, the app was likely to get significant attention at launch. Thus, Scott’s team felt that the app at launch needed to feel complete and professional to avoid any potential damage to Adam Scott’s brand. Anything resembling a ‘minimum viable’ product, could risk being interpreted as ‘cheap’.</p>
      <p>After a number meetings, and a lot of back and forth, we settled on a vision for the product at launch: an intuitive golf scoring tool; an informative statistics view; a rich course discovery experience; and a scaled down golf news, articles and tour leaderboards section.</p>
      <p>This was a slightly more complex product vision than we initially imagined, and we now had an aggressive timeline to try and deliver it.</p>
